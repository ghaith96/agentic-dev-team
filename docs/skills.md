# Skills and Slash Commands

There are two kinds of reusable capabilities in this system:

- **Skills** (`/skills/`) — knowledge modules that agents read for domain expertise (patterns, guidelines, procedures). Agent-agnostic; any agent can reference them.
- **Slash commands** (`/commands/`) — user-invocable workflows with numbered steps, argument parsing, and structured output. Executed under Orchestrator direction.

## How Agents Use Skills

Agents reference skills in their `## Skills` section with invocation context:

```markdown
## Skills
- [Hexagonal Architecture](../skills/hexagonal-architecture.md) - invoke when structuring new services
- [Domain-Driven Design](../skills/domain-driven-design.md) - invoke when modeling bounded contexts
```

The annotation explains *when and why* that agent uses the skill. The skill itself defines *how* and is agent-agnostic.

## Add a Knowledge Skill

1. Create `.claude/skills/{skill-name}.md` with the required sections (see template below)
2. Add it to the Skills Registry table in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
3. Reference it from each relevant agent's `## Skills` section with invocation context

### Skill Template

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: When to trigger this skill and what it does.
role: worker
user-invocable: true
---

# [Skill Name]

## Overview
[What this skill covers and why it matters]

## Core Concepts
[Key terminology and mental models]

## Patterns
[Named patterns with when-to-use guidance]

## Project Structure (if applicable)
[Directory layout this skill implies]

## Guidelines
[Actionable rules for applying this skill]
```

See [Agent & Skill Authoring](../.claude/skills/agent-skill-authoring.md) for detailed guidelines and anti-patterns.

## Add a Slash Command

For a new review agent command, use `/add-agent`. For a new workflow command, create `.claude/commands/{name}.md` following the slash command structure (YAML frontmatter with `user-invocable: true`, `Role:` declaration, constraints, numbered steps). Run `/agent-audit` after creation.
