# Agent & Skill Registry (Full)

This file contains the complete registry tables. CLAUDE.md references this file for on-demand loading — the orchestrator reads it when routing decisions require the full catalog.

## Review Agents

Spawned by the orchestrator during Phase 3 inline checkpoints and full `/code-review` runs. Model selection follows the **Orchestrator Model Routing Table** in `agents/orchestrator.md`.

| security-review | `agents/security-review.md` | frontier | Injection, auth/authz, data exposure, crypto |
| structure-review | `agents/structure-review.md` | mid | SRP violations, DRY, coupling, file organization |
| svelte-review | `agents/svelte-review.md` | mid | Svelte reactivity pitfalls, closure state leaks |
| test-review | `agents/test-review.md` | mid | Coverage gaps, assertion quality, test hygiene |
| token-efficiency-review | `agents/token-efficiency-review.md` | small | File/function size, LLM anti-patterns, token usage |

## Skills Registry

Skills are reusable knowledge modules in `.claude/skills/` that agents reference. They define patterns, guidelines, and project structures without being tied to any single agent persona.

## Subagent Prompt Templates

Concrete prompt templates in `prompts/` that the orchestrator and `/code-review` use when dispatching subagents, making behavior reproducible.

| Template | File | Used By |
|----------|------|---------|
| Implementer | `prompts/implementer.md` | Orchestrator (Phase 3 implementation dispatch) |
| Spec Reviewer | `prompts/spec-reviewer.md` | Orchestrator (two-stage review gate 1) |
| Quality Reviewer | `prompts/quality-reviewer.md` | Orchestrator (two-stage review gate 2) |
| Plan Reviewer | `prompts/plan-reviewer.md` | Orchestrator (Phase 2 automated pre-check) |

## Knowledge Files

Knowledge files in `knowledge/` provide progressive disclosure — agents read them on demand during analysis rather than carrying all detection patterns inline.

| File | ~Tokens | Used By |
|------|---------|---------|
| Agent Registry | `knowledge/agent-registry.md` | 1,200 | Orchestrator (routing decisions) |
| Review Template | `knowledge/review-template.md` | 400 | `/code-review` (report assembly) |
| Review Rubric | `knowledge/review-rubric.md` | 300 | `/code-review` (health scoring) |
| OWASP Detection | `knowledge/owasp-detection.md` | 600 | security-review |
| Domain Modeling | `knowledge/domain-modeling.md` | 500 | domain-review |
| Architecture Assessment | `knowledge/architecture-assessment.md` | 450 | arch-review |
