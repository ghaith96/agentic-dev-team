# Agent & Skill Authoring

## Overview

This skill defines how to create and maintain agents and skills within the Agentic Scrum Team system. Agents own orchestration logic (when and why); skills own execution knowledge (how). This separation keeps agents readable as workflow definitions while keeping capabilities DRY across the team.

## Constraints
- Skills must be agent-agnostic; no persona or behavioral logic in skill files
- Execution details belong in skills; orchestration logic belongs in agents
- Every new agent or skill must be registered in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Do not embed a skill's knowledge inline in an agent — reference the skill file

## Core Pattern

```
Agent (when + why)          Skill (how)
┌─────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────┐
│ ## Skills        │        │ # Skill Name    │
│ - Skill A ──────│───────>│                 │
│   "Invoke when  │        │ ## Concepts     │

│                 │        │                 │

└─────────────────┘        └─────────────────┘
```

- **Agents** define the *role*: persona, behavior, collaboration style, and *when/why* to use each skill
- **Skills** define the *capability*: concepts, patterns, guidelines, and project structures
- An agent references a skill and annotates it with invocation context
- Multiple agents can share the same skill, each with different invocation context

## Creating an Agent

### File Location
`.claude/agents/{role-name}.md`

### Required Sections

```markdown
# [Role Name] Agent

## Technical Responsibilities
- [Primary capabilities in imperative form]
- [Keep to 4-8 items that define the role's scope]

## Skills
- [Skill Name](../skills/{skill-file}.md) - [When/why this agent uses it]
- [Skill Name](../skills/{skill-file}.md) - [When/why this agent uses it]

## Collaboration Protocols

### Primary Collaborators
- [Agent Name]: [Nature of collaboration - what they exchange]

### Communication Style
- [Tone and approach]
- [Level of detail]
- [Update frequency]

## Behavioral Guidelines

### Decision Making
- Autonomy level: [High/Moderate/Low] for [what]
- Escalation criteria: [When to escalate]
- Human approval requirements: [What needs human sign-off]

### Conflict Management
- [How to handle disagreements with other agents]
- [Resolution protocols]
- [Escalation paths]

## Psychological Profile
- Work style: [Preferences]
- Problem-solving approach: [Methods]
- Quality vs. speed trade-offs: [Tendencies]

## Success Metrics
- [Measurable KPIs for this role]
```

### Agent Authoring Guidelines
- Keep agents focused on orchestration: *when* to act, *who* to collaborate with, *why* to escalate
- Execution details belong in skills, not in the agent persona
- The Skills section links to skill files with a short annotation explaining invocation context
- If an agent's Technical Responsibilities section grows beyond 8 items, extract a skill
- Behavioral Guidelines define personality and judgment, not technical procedures

## Creating a Skill

### File Location
`.claude/skills/{skill-name}.md`

### Required Sections

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: When to trigger this skill and what it does. Be specific about the contexts that should cause an agent to invoke it.
role: worker
user-invocable: true
---

# [Skill Name]

## Overview
[1-2 sentences: what this skill covers and why it matters]

## Core Concepts
[Key terminology and mental models needed to apply this skill]

## Patterns
[Named patterns with descriptions, when to use, and examples]

## Project Structure (if applicable)
[Directory layout or file organization this skill implies]

## Guidelines
[Actionable rules for applying this skill correctly]
```

### Skill Authoring Guidelines
- Skills must be agent-agnostic: no references to specific agent personas or behaviors
- Write in imperative/instructional tone, not persona-driven
- Include "when to apply" vs. "when not to apply" guidance to prevent over-application
- Use tables for decision matrices (situation -> approach)
- Include project structure templates when the skill implies a file organization
- Keep skills focused on a single cohesive topic; split broad topics into multiple skills

### Writing Effective Skills (Meta-Patterns)

Before writing a new skill, read 2-3 existing skills in `skills/` to absorb the project's voice and structure. Skills that follow existing patterns integrate better.

**Explain the why, not just the what.** LLMs follow rules more reliably when they understand the reasoning. "Do X because Y happens without it" beats "ALWAYS do X." Compare:
- Weak: "ALWAYS run tests before claiming done"
- Strong: "Run tests before claiming done — LLMs confidently claim 'done' without verification, and this is the single most common failure mode"

**Include rationalization prevention.** LLMs generate plausible excuses to skip hard steps. Add an "Excuses vs. Reality" table that pre-empts the common rationalizations for the skill's domain. This is the most effective compliance pattern in this project.

**Use hard gates, not soft suggestions.** "Should" is ignored; "must, with evidence" is followed. Gate pattern: require tool output (paste the result) as proof that a step was completed. Without evidence, the agent cannot proceed.

**Constrain scope explicitly.** Skills that try to cover everything get applied inconsistently. Define clear boundaries: what this skill covers, what it doesn't, and what adjacent skills handle the rest.

**Test against the forgetting curve.** Skills are most likely to be skipped when the agent is deep in implementation and eager to deliver. Front-load the most critical constraints in the skill's ## Constraints section — they're read first and remembered longest.

## Registration

After creating an agent or skill, update all of the following. Incomplete registration leaves the system in an inconsistent state.

### For a New Team Agent
1. Add to the **Team Agents** table in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
2. Add a node and edges to the team diagram in `docs/team-structure.md`
3. Add a row to the Team Agents table in `docs/agent_info.md`
4. Define collaboration edges with existing agents

### For a New Review Agent
Use `/agent-add` — it handles all registration steps automatically. For manual creation:
1. Add to the **Review Agents** table in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
2. Add a row to the Review Agents table in `docs/agent_info.md`
3. Add to the dispatch diagram in `docs/team-structure.md`
4. Add eval fixtures to `.claude/evals/fixtures/` and expected results to `.claude/evals/expected/`

### For a New Knowledge Skill
1. Add to the **Skills Registry** table in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
2. Add to the appropriate section of `docs/skills.md`
3. Reference it from each relevant agent's `## Skills` section with invocation context

### For a New Slash Command
1. Add to the **Slash Commands Registry** table in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
2. Add to the appropriate section of `docs/skills.md`
3. Add a row to the relevant table in `docs/usage.md` if user-facing

## Documentation Sync Policy

**Every change to this repository must be reflected in documentation.** This is enforced at three levels:

1. **Hook** — `eval-compliance-check.sh` fires on every Edit/Write to any file and emits targeted doc sync reminders:
   - Agent/command files → run `/agent-audit`, update registry tables and docs
   - Hook/settings/CLAUDE.md → verify setup and registry docs
   - Any other substantive file → check usage, architecture, setup, or README as appropriate
2. **Commands** — `/agent-add` and `/agent-remove` include mandatory documentation update steps. The tech-writer persona reviews all modified docs before the command reports completion.
3. **Orchestrator Phase 3 gate** — Before every human gate at the end of Phase 3, the orchestrator invokes the tech-writer to review all documentation affected by the implementation. No task is marked complete until docs reflect current behavior and architecture.

Files that must stay in sync:

| Change type | Source of truth | Must match |
|---|---|---|
| Agent files | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` agent tables | `docs/agent_info.md` tables |
| Slash commands | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` slash commands table | `docs/skills.md` commands tables + `docs/usage.md` commands table |
| Model routing | `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` Model Routing Table | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` Model Routing summary |
| Team structure | `docs/team-structure.md` Mermaid diagrams | Actual agent files in `.claude/agents/` |
| Behavior/workflow | `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md` Phase workflow | `docs/usage.md` Three-Phase Workflow + `README.md` |
| Architecture | `docs/architecture.md` | `README.md` architecture section |
| Config/setup | `.claude/settings.json` + hook scripts | `docs/setup.md` Hooks and Plugins sections |

## Output
New or updated `.claude/agents/*.md` or `.claude/skills/*.md` file(s) with all registry tables and docs updated. Be concise — confirm what was created/updated and its registration status.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill logic embedded in agent | Duplicated across agents, hard to update | Extract to a skill file, reference from agent |
| Agent behavior embedded in skill | Skill becomes role-specific, can't be reused | Move persona/judgment logic to the agent |
| Skill without any agent reference | Orphaned knowledge, never invoked | Add to relevant agents or remove |
| Agent without Skills section | All knowledge is inline, nothing is reusable | Identify extractable capabilities |
| Overly broad skill | Tries to cover too much, hard to reference precisely | Split into focused skills |
