# Agentic Scrum Team - Orchestration Pipeline

## System Overview

This project implements a fully automated development team using persona-driven AI agents orchestrated through an intelligent coordination pipeline. The Orchestrator agent acts as the central dispatcher, routing tasks to specialized agents based on task classification, complexity, and required expertise.

## Core Principles

1. **Selective Agent Loading**: Only load necessary agents into context, avoiding token bloat. Target < 10,000 tokens for simple tasks.
2. **40% Context Window Rule**: Maintain context below 40% capacity to prevent hallucination. Trigger summarization at threshold.
3. **Persona-Driven Behavior**: Each agent has detailed psychological and behavioral specifications defined in `.claude/agents/`.
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Agents are autonomous but require oversight, not copilots.
5. **Dynamic Configuration**: User-level configuration updates through federated learning.
6. **Acceptance Test Driven Development**: All development follows ATDD. Behaviors are defined as scenarios in feature files (Gherkin) before implementation begins. Feature file scenarios are the single source of truth for expected behavior — no implementation without a corresponding scenario, no scenario without a corresponding test.

## Request Processing Flow

For trivial tasks (typo fix, simple query), the Orchestrator routes directly to a single agent. For non-trivial tasks, the Orchestrator follows the **Research → Plan → Implement** workflow:

### Three-Phase Workflow
1. **Research** — Understand the system: find relevant files, trace data flows, identify the problem surface area. Sub-agents explore the codebase and return concise findings to keep the parent context clean. Output: research progress file written to `memory/`.
2. **Human Review Gate** — Human reviews research findings. Catching a misunderstanding here prevents hundreds of bad lines of code.
3. **Plan** — Specify every change: files, snippets, test strategy, verification steps. The plan is the primary review artifact — 200 lines of plan is far more reviewable than 2,000 lines of code. Output: implementation plan progress file written to `memory/`.
4. **Human Review Gate** — Human reviews the plan. This replaces traditional line-by-line code review as the primary quality gate.
5. **Implement** — Execute the plan. Write code, run tests, verify at each step. Run `/code-review --changed` on all modified files before committing. If the plan is good, implementation is mechanical. Output: working code + test results + code review pass.
6. **Human Review Gate** — Human reviews the final output. Lightweight if the plan was correct.
7. **Learning loop** — Update configs if needed, log metrics, refine routing.

### Phase Transitions
Each phase runs in a fresh context window. The output of each phase is a structured progress file in `memory/` that onboards the next phase. See the Orchestrator agent for the full protocol.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol

### Sub-Agents as Context Isolation

The primary value of sub-agents is **context isolation**, not persona specialization. When a parent agent dispatches a sub-agent to explore, search, or analyze, the sub-agent absorbs the context burden of reading files and tracing code flows. Only a concise, structured finding returns to the parent — keeping the parent's context clean and focused on the actual task.

**Design sub-agent calls for minimal context return**:
- Send the sub-agent a specific question ("Where is user authentication handled? Return file paths and line numbers.")
- The sub-agent reads 20 files; the parent receives 10 lines of structured findings
- The parent can get right to work without the context burden of exploration

Persona specialization (Software Engineer, Architect, etc.) provides behavioral guardrails and domain expertise, but context isolation is what makes multi-agent workflows scale.

### Multi-Agent Coordination

When a task requires multiple agents:
1. Orchestrator identifies multi-agent task and assigns the three-phase workflow
2. Load primary agent + sub-agents for the current phase only
3. Sub-agents explore and return concise findings (context isolation)
4. Primary agent coordinates (defines interfaces, manages dependencies, resolves conflicts)
5. Phase output is written to `memory/` as a progress file
6. Human reviews before next phase begins
7. Integration and validation (QA validates, Architect reviews if architectural changes)
8. Unified result delivery

## Multi-LLM Routing

| Criteria | Claude | Gemini |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Task complexity | Complex tasks | Simple, high-volume |
| Cost sensitivity | Premium | Cost-optimized |
| Context requirements | Large context needs | Standard context |
| Precision requirements | Critical components | Standard components |

## Context Management

Context management is the Orchestrator's responsibility, governed by two operational skills:

1. **[Context Loading Protocol](skills/context-loading-protocol.md)** - decides *what* to load and *when*, using task classification, phased loading, and measured token budgets
2. **[Context Summarization](skills/context-summarization.md)** - decides *when* to compress and *how*, using LSTM-inspired gates, utilization triggers, and structured summaries written to `memory/`

### Baseline Budget
- CLAUDE.md (always loaded): ~870 tokens
- Single agent + single skill: ~600-1,100 tokens
- All agents (no skills): ~3,430 tokens
- Full load (all agents + all skills): ~14,200 tokens

### Operating Rules
1. **Load on demand**: Only load agent/skill files when their phase begins (see Loading Protocol)
2. **40% utilization ceiling**: Trigger summarization when proxy signals indicate 40%+ utilization
3. **Phase transitions**: Summarize completed phases to `memory/` before loading next-phase agents
4. **Summaries replace history**: New conversations read from `memory/`, not from prior conversation replay

## Feedback & Learning

Users can modify system behavior at any time using trigger keywords (`amend`, `learn`, `remember`, `forget`). The full procedure is defined in **[Feedback & Learning](skills/feedback-learning.md)**.

Changes are logged to `metrics/config-changelog.jsonl` with full audit trail and rollback support.

## Human Oversight

Agents operate autonomously within defined boundaries. Human involvement is required for high-impact decisions (production deployments, architecture changes, scope modifications). The full protocol is defined in **[Human Oversight Protocol](skills/human-oversight-protocol.md)**.

Intervention commands: `amend`, `learn`, `remember`, `forget`, `override`, `pause`, `stop`.

## Quality & Accuracy

All agents apply self-validation before delivering output. The QA agent performs peer validation when applicable. See **[Accuracy Validation](skills/accuracy-validation.md)** for the checklist and confidence scoring system.

Audit logging, quality gates, and ethics principles are defined in **[Governance & Compliance](skills/governance-compliance.md)**.

## Performance Metrics

Task completion data is logged to `metrics/` in JSONL format. See **[Performance Metrics](skills/performance-metrics.md)** for the schema and reporting cadence.

### Targets
- 10-15% overall efficiency gains
- 95% accuracy on structured data extraction
- < 5% hallucination rate with context management
- 95% accuracy maintained across full conversation lifecycle
- > 80% first-pass acceptance rate
