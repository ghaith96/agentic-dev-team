  Run eval fixtures against review agents and grade results. Use this after

  when the user says "run the evals", "test the agents", "check for
  regressions", or "how accurate is the agent".

# Agent Eval

Role: orchestrator. This skill dispatches fixtures to agents and
grades results — it does not review code itself.

You have been invoked with the `/agent-eval` skill. Run review agents
against eval fixtures and grade the results.

## Orchestrator constraints

1. **Do not review code yourself.** Delegate all reviews to
   `/review-agent`. Your job is dispatching and grading.
2. **Grade deterministically.** Compare agent JSON output against
   expected JSON using exact criteria (status match, count ranges,
   keyword checks). Do not apply judgment.
3. **Minimize context per agent.** Pass only the fixture file to the
   agent — not the expected results, not other fixtures, not prior
   transcripts.
4. **Track results.** Save transcripts for saturation detection. Do
   not modify fixtures or expected files.
5. **Be concise.** Output the report table and failure details. No
   narration of each fixture run — just the grades.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

- `--agent <name>`: Run only the named agent
  (e.g., `js-fp-review`)
- `--fixture <name>`: Run only the named fixture
  (e.g., `fp-array-mutations.ts`)
- `--trials <n>`: Run each fixture N times (default: 1). Enables
  pass@k scoring.
- `--verbose`: Show full agent output for each fixture
- No arguments: run all agents against all applicable fixtures

## Steps

### 1. Resolve eval corpus

Verify `.claude/evals/fixtures/` exists. If not, error:
"Cannot find eval fixtures. Expected at `.claude/evals/fixtures/`."

### 2. Load fixtures and expected results

Read all files from `.claude/evals/fixtures/` and corresponding JSON from
`.claude/evals/expected/`.

For each fixture:

- Match the fixture stem (filename without extension) to its
  expected JSON
- For directory fixtures (cs-*), the directory name is the stem
- Parse `applicableAgents` to know which agents to run

If `--agent` is specified, filter to fixtures where that agent is in
`applicableAgents`.
If `--fixture` is specified, filter to that fixture only.

### 3. Run agents against fixtures

For each fixture/agent pair:

1. Invoke `/review-agent <agent-name>` with the fixture
   file/directory as the target
2. Parse the agent's JSON output to extract: `status`, `issues[]`,
   `summary`
3. If running multiple trials (`--trials`), repeat and collect all
   results

### 4. Grade each result

Compare agent output against expected JSON:

**Status match:**

- Agent status matches `expectedStatus` → PASS
- Agent status is "skip" and fixture is not in
  `applicableAgents` → PASS (correct skip)
- Mismatch → FAIL

**Issue count:**

- `issues.length` within `issueCount.min` to
  `issueCount.max` → PASS
- Outside range → FAIL

**Severity counts:**

- For each severity in expected `severities`, count matching issues
- Count within `min` to `max` → PASS
- Outside range → FAIL

**Keyword checks:**

- For each keyword in `mustMention`: at least one issue message
  contains keyword (case-insensitive) → PASS
- For each keyword in `mustNotMention`: no issue message contains
  keyword → PASS
- Violation → FAIL

Each check produces PASS/FAIL. Overall fixture grade: PASS only if
all checks pass.

### 5. Compute pass@k (multi-trial)

If `--trials` > 1:

- pass@1: fraction of fixtures that passed on the first trial
- pass@k: fraction of fixtures that passed on at least one of k
  trials
- Consistency: fraction of fixtures with identical results across
  all trials

### 6. Detect eval saturation

Track the last 3 runs in `.claude/evals/transcripts/`. If the last 3
consecutive runs for an agent produce identical grades, flag as
"saturated" — the expected ranges may need tightening.

### 7. Save transcript

Create `.claude/evals/transcripts/<timestamp>-<agent>.json`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-01T12:00:00Z",
  "agent": "<name>",
  "trials": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "fixture": "<name>",
      "grade": "pass|fail",
      "checks": {
        "status": "pass|fail",
        "issueCount": "pass|fail",
        "severities": "pass|fail",
        "mustMention": "pass|fail"
      },
      "agentOutput": { "status": "...", "issues": [], "summary": "..." }
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 0,
    "passed": 0,
    "failed": 0,
    "passRate": "N%",
    "passAtK": "N%",
    "saturated": ["agent-name"]
  }
}
```

### 8. Generate report

Save to `.claude/evals/reports/<timestamp>-report.md` and display:

```text
# Eval Report — <timestamp>

## Summary
| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Fixtures | N |
| Passed | N |
| Failed | N |
| Pass rate | N% |
| Pass@k | N% (k=N) |
| Saturated | N agents |

## Results by Agent
| Agent | Fixtures | Passed | Failed | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| js-fp-review | 6 | 5 | 1 | 83% |
| ... | | | | |

## Failures
| Fixture | Agent | Check | Expected | Got |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fp-array-mutations.ts | js-fp-review | issueCount | 4-8 | 2 |
| ... | | | | |

## Saturation Warnings
- js-fp-review: 3 identical runs — consider tightening ranges
```

### 9. Progress tracking

Copy and update this checklist:

```text
- [ ] Eval corpus resolved
- [ ] Fixtures loaded
- [ ] Expected results loaded
- [ ] Agents executed
- [ ] Results graded
- [ ] Transcript saved
- [ ] Report generated
```
